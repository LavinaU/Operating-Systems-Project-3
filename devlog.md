### Thoughts
Starting Project 3 for Operating Systems Concepts. I know this is late but I had finals all week so I figured I'd take the late points. I worked on it before finals week but not throughly. l I will initialize git today, create this devlog, obviously, and test and commit the skeleton setup. 

### My Plan
- Initialize Git
- Create devlog.md
- Commit initial setup
