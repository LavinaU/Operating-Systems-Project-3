# Development Log

### Thoughts
Starting Project 3 for Operating Systems Concepts. I know this is late but I had finals all week so I figured I'd take the late points. I worked on it before finals week but not throughly. l I will initialize git today, create this devlog, obviously, and test and commit the skeleton setup. 

### My Plan
- Initialize Git
- Create devlog.md
- Commit initial setup

### Thoughts
Got caught up with another task but back on. Going to implement the create command and header file handling

### My Plan
- implement create
- initialize index file w/ header

### Thoughts
Create command implementation is done! In a good workflow now. Going to add the first part of real BTree functionality now. Shouldn't take too long.

### My Plan
- set up BTree node structure & placeholder for insert command
